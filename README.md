# AngularJS Lyrics Search App

## Overview

Super simple app to demonstrate how to set up an Angular project with Webpack and ES6 + a really basic
nodejs server.

## Running

You need node with npm and `grunt-cli` installed. Then run:

`grunt build`

to build the application. To run the node server type :

`node server/server.js`

## Tests

There are few basic unit tests. To run the suite, type :

`grunt karma:dev`

in the terminal.

## Licensing

Everything apart of the design is MIT. I don't own the design.
